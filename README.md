The first step will be to proceed with the page setup via COMMAND PROMPT. You can see how I proceeded at this stage on the page below.

After all these steps, I downloaded visualcode from the internet and defined the latest version of Python into visualcode from the terminal.

And now, when I ran the #python manage.py runserver # command in a new terminal panel, the system opened my homepage for me.

In the next stages, I proceeded by watching the project videos and found the errors I received by searching on the internet.

My main aim in this project is to show that the income of some products is spent on stray animals..
Moreover, my product named Hasen's mug is the same as my cat Tomas..

75% of my project is completed. At this stage, I wanted to adjust the template sizes on the homepage and keep the background colored, but it did not work.
However, you will encounter a very cute coffee mug sales page in this project.
